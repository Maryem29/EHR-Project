# EHR-Project
EHR Information System Project
Project Features and requirements
The frontend is with HTML 5, CSS 3 and Bootstrap 5+. Any modern JS lib like Angular, Vue or React
can be used but NOT recommended. Note, nothing wrong with the any JS lib, it is fantastic to try them,
but, in this course, we have to keep the code primitive, use limited JS lib.
The backend is with PHP and MySQL, OR Python, Flask and MySQL
(I suppose you have basic Python knowledge from other courses, Python will not be covered in this course)
1. The GUI should include a navigation menu with a couple of static pages such as contextual info
about the EHR, login window, new doctor registration, about us, etc.
2. Registration and Login function. This should include doctor registration, login with username and
password check. Strong password suggestion (optional 1), forget password with email (optional 2),
registration with email confirmation (optional 3).
3. After a doctor logged in, the doctor can CRUD the EHR data, the CRUD function has more weight
when marking the project. Each doctor can only view his/her list of patient EHR, and make CRUD
operation from there.
3.1. The doctor can CRUD patient EHR.
3.2. EHRs may include a range of data, including demographics, medical history, medication and
allergies, immunization status, laboratory test results, radiology images, vital signs, personal
statistics like age and weight, and billing information. In the project, there should be at least
3 input data, 1 check box data, 1 radio data, 1 input data for date (optional 4), a datepicker
from some JS lib (optional 5), 1 textarea data (optional 6), and 1 image upload and display
function (optional 7).
4. Evaluation - Conduct a SUS utility survey to evaluate your EHR Information System, refer to the
study material 2, and https://measuringu.com/sus/
5. Write a report and make a presentation for the project.
Project output

2. In the report, write down your website design and technical architecture.
3. In the report, describe your EHR information system like a user manual, basically, snapshot +
descriptions. As detailed as possible.
4. In the report, write down the evaluation of the EHR information system. Questionnaire
snapshots, SUS score calculation need to be there.
5. In the report, write down who did what in the project.
6. In the presentation, describe all the works for your project.
In the same project, different students may have different scores, this depends on who did what.
